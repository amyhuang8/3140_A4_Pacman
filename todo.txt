admin login:
- display sign up/login page first
	- sign up info would save to database
- display login panel in html/php
- fetch admin login info from database and compare
- if correct, change modal to "manage leaderboard"
	- have buttons to 1. clear leaderboard or 2. change list size
	- 1. clearing leaderboard would delete the leaderboard table in the database
	- 2. update sql command for how many rows to fetch from the db

db:
- 2 tables: one with all user info (username, location, high score) & 2nd for leaderboard (username and high score)
